# json-serialization-libraries
Sample usages for some JSON serialization libraries like Jackson and Gson.

# Credits
Thoughts of writing this sample project were inspired by Josh Dreyfuss's [post](http://blog.takipi.com/the-ultimate-json-library-json-simple-vs-gson-vs-jackson-vs-json/) in [Tapiki Blog](http://blog.takipi.com/).

So I decided to create usage examples of all 4 libraries mentioned in this post.
